Algorithm - Assignment 2


Problem:
The problem is calculating wage, storing the user’s name with string, and setting up a function.


Input:
        The user will input their first name, hourly rate, and hours worked.


Output:
        The user’s wage earned with their name.


Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Before int main() set up the wage calculation function
2. Declare variables calculateWage, r, and h
3. Declare variable w and initialize to 0
4. Set up if statement if the user did not work overtime
   1. Only allow hours to be between 0 and 40 (including those) and rate to be 0 or above
   2. Set w = r * h
1. Set up else if statement if the user worked overtime (over 40 hours) and makes less than or equal to $25 an hour
   1. Hours need to be above 40 and rate needs to be between 0 and 25 (including those)
   2. Set w = (r * 40) + (r * 2 ) * (h - 40)
1. Set up else if statement if the user worked overtime (over 40 hours) and makes more than $25 an hour
   1. Hours need to be above 40 and rate needs to be over 25
   2. Set wage = (r * 40) + (r * 1.5) * (h - 40)
1. Set up else statement to say “Please try again.” if the user enters something invalid
2. After int main()
3. Display welcome message
4. Skip lines
5. Prompt user to enter their first name
6. Declare name variable using string
7. Let user input their name and store it
8. Skip line
9. Prompt user to enter their hourly rate
10. Declare rate variable and initialize to 0
11. Let user input their rate and store it
12. Skip line
13. Prompt user to enter their hours worked
14. Declare hours variable and initialize to 0
15. Let user input their hours and store it
16. Skip line
17. Declare wage variable and initialize to 0
18. Use wage function with variables rate and hours to find wage
19. Display the user’s calculated wage along with their name on screen
20. Skip lines
21. Display goodbye message
22. Skip line
