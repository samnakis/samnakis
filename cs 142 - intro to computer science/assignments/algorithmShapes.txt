Problem:
        The problem is finding the area of multiple shapes.


Input:
        The user will input numbers for side lengths of multiple shapes.


Output:
        The area of a shape.


Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Print a welcome message on the screen
2. Print a title for the first shape (rectangle)
3. Declare variables needed to calculate and display area (length, width, area)
4. Skip line
5. Prompt user to enter first number (length)
6. Skip line
7. Prompt user to enter second number (width)
8. Set area equal to length times width
9. Skip line
10. Print out the area
11. Skip two lines
12. Print a title for the second shape (square)
13. Declare variables needed to calculate and display area (side, area)
14. Skip line
15. Prompt user to enter a number (side length)
16. Set area equal to side length squared
17. Skip line
18. Print out the area
19. Skip two lines
20. Print a title for the third shape (triangle)
21. Declare variables needed to calculate and display area (base, height, area)
22. Skip line
23. Prompt user to enter the first number (base)
24. Skip line
25. Prompt user to enter the second number (height)
26. Set area equal to (base times height) divided by two
27. Skip line
28. Print out area
29. Skip two lines
30. Print out a goodbye message on the screen
