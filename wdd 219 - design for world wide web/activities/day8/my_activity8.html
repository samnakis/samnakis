    <h1>Polar Vortex Strikes Indiana</h1>

    <p>This is a simple text file that was created on February 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021.  It was a cold day outside.  All the H<sub>2</sub>0 was frozen.  Chris Braun, a local Hoosier, had difficulty digging his car out of the snow. &quot;It was an ordeal&quot;, said Braun, &quot;I had to shovel off my 20 &times; 8 parking spot.  That&rsquo;s 160 ft<sup>2</sup> man!  I would pay &pound;10 for someone to do that!  I would pay more, but I don&rsquo;t wear Dolce &amp; Gabbana if you know what I&rsquo;m saying.&quot;</p>

    <p>A weary Braun then returned to work writing a webpage for his sister&rsquo;s recording company &lt;Super Art&gt; &trade;.</p>
