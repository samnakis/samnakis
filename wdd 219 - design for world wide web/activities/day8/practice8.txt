Polar Vortex Strikes Indiana

This is a simple text file that was created on Februaru 17th, 2021.  It was a cold day outside.  All the H20 was frozen.  Chris Braun, a local Hoosier, had difficulty digging his car out of the snow.  "It was an ordeal", said Braun, "I had to shovel off my 20 x 8 parking spot.  That's 160 ft2 man!  I would pay pound 10 for someone to do that!  I would pay more, but I don't wear Dolce & Gabbana if you know what I'm saying."

A weary Braun then returned to work writing a webpage for his sister's recording company <Super Art>trademark.
