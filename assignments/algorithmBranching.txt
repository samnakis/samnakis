2. Skip lines
3. Prompt user to enter their hourly rate
4. Declare rate variable and initialize to 0
5. Let user input their rate and store it
6. Skip line
7. Prompt user to enter their hours worked
8. Declare hours variable and initialize to 0
9. Let user input their hours and store it
10. Skip line
11. Declare wage variable and initialize to 0
12. Set up if statement if the user did not work overtime
   1. Only allow hours to be between 0 and 40 (including those) and rate to be 0 or above
   2. Set wage = rate * hours
1. Set up else if statement if the user worked overtime (over 40 hours) and makes less than or equal to $25 an hour
   1. Hours need to be above 40 and rate needs to be between 0 and 25 (including those)
   2. Set wage = (rate * 40) + (rate * 2 ) * (hours - 40)
1. Set up else if statement if the user worked overtime (over 40 hours) and makes more than $25 an hour
   1. Hours need to be above 40 and rate needs to be over 25
   2. Set wage = (rate * 40) + (rate * 1.5) * (hours - 40)
1. Set up else statement to say “Please try again.” if the user enters something invalid 
2. Display the user’s calculated wage on screen
3. Skip lines
4. Display goodbye message
5. Skip line
